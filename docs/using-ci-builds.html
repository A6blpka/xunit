<h1>Using CI Builds</h1>

<p>
  The <a href="/#packages">packages table on the home page</a> lists the current available builds.
  The column titled "Latest CI" indicates the version of the most recent build that was pushed
  automatically as a result of new code being pushed to GitHub. These automated builds are currently
  sent to <a href="https://feedz.io/org/xunit/repository/xunit/search">feedz.io</a> (that link will
  require you to log into your feedz.io account, which is free if you don't already have one).
</p>

<p>
  In order to consume packages from this feed, you need to create or update the <code>NuGet.Config</code>
  file for your project. Here is an example:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
    <add key="feedz.io/xunit/xunit" value="https://f.feedz.io/xunit/xunit/nuget/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This NuGet.Config file sets two feed sources: the official source from NuGet, and the feed from feedz.io.
  (Note that while you need an account to view the feedz.io website, you do not need any account to restore
  packages, so using this NuGet.Config should be relatively friction free.) You should place the NuGet.Config
  file into the same folder at the top level folder of your source repository so that it will be used for
  all package operations in your project.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the order of the package sources matters: the first listed source (nuget.org in this case) has the
  highest priority. That means if the package is available from nuget.org with the version you requested, it
  will be sourced from there, even if the same version is available on a later package feed.
</p>
