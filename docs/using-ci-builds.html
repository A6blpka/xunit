<h1>Using CI Builds</h1>

<p>
  The <a href="/#packages">packages table on the home page</a> lists the currently available builds.
  The column titled "Latest CI" indicates the version of the most recent build that was pushed
  automatically as a result of new code being pushed to GitHub. These automated builds are currently
  sent to <a href="https://feedz.io/org/xunit/repository/xunit/search">feedz.io</a> (that link will
  require you to log into your feedz.io account, which is free if you don't already have one).
</p>

<p>
  In order to consume packages from this feed, you need to create or update the <code>NuGet.Config</code>
  file for your project. Here is an example:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
    <add key="feedz.io/xunit/xunit" value="https://f.feedz.io/xunit/xunit/nuget/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This <code>NuGet.Config</code> file sets two feed sources: the official source from NuGet, and the feed
  from <code>feedz.io</code>. (Note that while you need an account to view the <code>feedz.io</code> website,
  you do not need an account to restore packages, so using this <code>NuGet.Config</code> should be relatively
  friction free.) We recommend that you place the <code>NuGet.Config</code> file into the top level folder of
  your source repository so that it will be used for all package operations in your project.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the order of the package sources matters: the first listed source (<code>nuget.org</code> in this case)
  has the highest priority. That means if the package is available from <code>nuget.org</code> with the version
  you requested, it will be sourced from there, even if the same version is available on a later package feed.
</p>
